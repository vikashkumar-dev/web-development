<h1>Mustang GT Fastbac (POCHINKI)</h1>
<p>The word everyday sports car is a bit overused but in the case of the Mustang it is absolutely true. It takes to our bad
    roads with aplomb, has enough clearance to go over mountains or what we call speed breakers, is comfortable for two (rear
    seat is better used as extra luggage area), has that astounding 5.0-litre V8, can run on normal fuel and as I found out,
    it was quite efficient too (6.5kmpl is not too shabby for such a car.). So the Mustang is a sports car with none of the
    flaws of one. Sure it is not perfect, but priced at Rs 65 lakh (ex-Delhi), you get a lot of American muscle for your
    money. The Mustang has a rich heritage, is an icon and more importantly is an accomplished car too.</p>
